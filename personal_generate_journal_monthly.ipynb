    "\t•\tIn Calgary, there was an outdoor hot tub. Ellen and I spent some time in it. It had just snowed. We threw snowballs at each other. Also, the hotel had a fantastic breakfast, and we got to eat at Harvey's :)\n",

    "\t•\tVacation week in Hawai'i. Amazing week. See the daily events, of course. But here's some highlights.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tMonday we went to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Definitely one of the big highlights of the trip. Watching the various songs, dances, and chants of the various cultures of the polynesian islands was super entertaining. I was most attracted to the Huka and the Hula. Very expressive dances.\n",
    "\t•\tWe got to try out a few cultural things as well. Fire making. Stick games. Leaf weaving.\n",
    "\t•\tA fantastic supper, followed by the Hā: Breath of Life presentation.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tTuesday we had planned kayaking, but it was quite a distance away, and on the leeward (ie. rainy) side of the island. So we went hiking instead. Jodi and Savannah stayed back. Savannah learned to make leis. \n",
    "\t•\tThe rest of us went up Koko head canyon, and then Judd trail and Ginger pond. The Koko head was a very straight, very steep rail-line. Neither Katrina nor I was sure we were going to make it, but make it all the way to the top we did. Fantastic views.\n",
    "\t•\tJudd trail was a complete jungle. Path covered in roots. Ended with Ginger Pond - a little freshwater pool in which we swam for a short while. Super unique experience.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tWednesday we visited Pearl Harbor and the Arizona memorial. Enjoyed the little videos, and all museums. Learned some history.\n",
    "\t•\tThen spent the afternoon lazing on the beach. Finished the day with a night swim in the ocean.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tThursday we walked to the harbour and spent some of the morning parasailing. It was super neat. Much calmer experience than I would have expected. Even gaining and losing a significant amount of altitude didn't \"feel\" like we were moving a lot. Much less, even, than the elevator in the hotel. Got to see a whale surfacing from far above.\n",
    "\t•\tIn the afternoon we rented surfboards. That was a disaster. The kids managed to get up just a little bit, but mostly they either fell, or just couldn't \"catch\" any waves (we couldn't figure out how to catch them, just kept floating over them). As for me, I couldn't even lay on the board long enough for the wave to approach me. I was already back in the water.\n",
    "\t•\tSwam a lot this afternoon. The water was warm. The air was warm. It was fabulous.\n",
    "\t•\tOne last ocean night swim.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tFriday was a flight and then a hotel.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tSaturday was a long drive.\n",
    "\t•\t\n",
    "\t•\tSunday the Lowry's were in town, and there was a \"snack & chat\" after church and I got to talk to Melina for awhile. We picked up Rebel.\n",
    "\t•\tAt suppertime, I took Lukas to the first instalment of an emotional resiliency class he's enrolled in.\n",

    "\t•\tSigned up kids for next round of swimming lessons.\n",
    "\t•\tMoreton's came over to get a lay of the land.\n",
    "\t•\tLots and lots of deeper cleaning in the house to get it ready for both a visit with the social worker, and for Moreton's to be here watching kids while we're gone.\n",
    "\t•\tDavina puked in the Expedition. Even more cleaning to do.\n",
    "\t•\tAnnaliess saw her horse as much as possible.\n",
    "\t•\tAnd then we left. Sarah Moreton came over. We loaded up the car, and we were on our way.\n",
    "\t•\tStopped at the Mongolian BBQ for lunch, and Flat Iron Grill for supper. Nice restaurants.\n",
    "\t•\tTrip took an extra hour due to heavy snow/slush and a few accidents in the snoqualmie pass. What a pain.\n",
    "\t•\tGot all the kids signed up for FSY.\n",
    "\t•\tMade the flight. Watched lots of movies. Met our driver without too much issue in Hawaii.\n",
    "\t•\tWent straight to the beach and swam. Water was big pool temperature. Cool, but nice, especially in the warm sun.\n",
    "\t•\tI managed to touch a sharp sea-urchin on my first evening. Got some painful slivers in my finger. That was a downer.\n",
    "\t•\tHad a bit of a fiasco connecting Jodi to her driver when her flight landed. Got it sorted while eating at a nice Mexican restaurant. Kids were surprised and happy to see her.\n",
    "\t•\tAnd then our vacation really started. Up early a bunch of days for tours and activities.\n",
    "\t•\tWe went scuba diving - two dives. Had a fantastic time. So much easier to dive in warmer waters without thick wetsuits. Saw lots of fish and turtles and some eels and beige coral.\n",
    "\t•\tSwam in the ocean a bunch. Swam in the hotel pool a lot.\n",
    "\t•\tWatched an open-air luau across the street from our hotel room, up on the 31st floor.\n",
    "\t•\tWent on a sight-seeing trip around the entire island. Saw a few very nice vistas, and unfortunately a lot of gift shops. Got some alright food from a food truck. Cold, though. Went snorkelling and love, love, loved it! Learned a lot from a fantastic tour guide. Lots of Hawaiian history. Saw the temple as we drove by. Had very good (and very expensive) Chinese food. All food here is crazy pricey.\n",
    "\t•\tWork\n",
    "\t•\tStarted reducing node count on our opensearch cluster. \n",
    "\t•\tHad an almost-incident with the new live config stuff. Applied settings to the wrong deployments. Luckily it didn't affect our main deployment. Just a scare.\n",
    "\t•\tTurned on txn completeness. One minor hiccup. Otherwise it went well.\n",
    "\t•\tAnd then started so many extractions again.\n",
    "\t•\tCrazy busy days trying to get everything in order before leaving on vacation.\n",
    "\t•\tGot address code fixed in monolith, with tests and feature flags, merged.\n",
    "\t•\tSet my status to OOO a day early, and just responded to the constant incoming flood of Slack messages.\n",

    "\t•\tLots of post-vacation catch up, and then it started as actually a bit of a slower week, which was super nice.\n",
    "\t•\tLots of extractions happening. Addresses, contacts, departments. Transactions and Sales taxes are coming up.\n",
    "\t•\tDid training. Submitted p-card expenses. Wrote feedback for Vishal. \n",
